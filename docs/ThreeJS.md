### Canvas

The `Canvas` object is your portal into Threejs. It renders Threejs elements, not DOM elements!

### Mesh

`Mesh` objects represent drawing a specific `Geometry` with a specific `Material`.
`position={[x, y, z]}`

`Geometry` objects represent the vertex data of some piece of geometry like a sphere, cube, plane, dog, cat, human, tree, building, etc... Three.js provides many kinds of built in [geometry primitives](https://threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/lessons/threejs-primitives.html). You can also create custom geometry as well as load geometry from files.
